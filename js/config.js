            "I am broadly interested in problems related to sequential or adaptive/interactive learning. Currently, I am interested in developing adaptive sampling algorithms for policy evaluation which has applications in fields like Causal Inference (ATE estimation) and Reinforcement Learning (Off-Policy Evaluation). In the past I have worked on related problems such as Best Arm Identification and RLHF.",
